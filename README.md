Markover
========

This directory contains the source code for Markover, a lightweight markup
language derived from John Gruber's Markdown.

Well, the beginnings of one, anyway. The idea was to write a
[lemon](http://www.hwaci.com/sw/lemon/)-based parser. I got as far as argument
processing and sketching out a simple API. But then real life got in the way.
Just as well, since there are some other great C-based Markdown parsers these
days, including:

* [Discount](http://www.pell.portland.or.us/~orc/Code/discount/)
* [peg-markdown](https://github.com/jgm/peg-markdown)
* [peg-multimarkdown](https://github.com/fletcher/peg-multimarkdown)
* [libupskirt](http://fossil.instinctive.eu/libupskirt/index)
* [Redcarpet](https://github.com/tanoku/redcarpet)

This repository is provided for informational purposes only, not that anyone
who knew what they were doing would have much interest. More of an historical
note for myself than anything else.
